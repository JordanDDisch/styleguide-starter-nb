# styleguide-starter-nb
This is a style guide workflow that can be used with Nation Builder to mock out single components and templates.

If you want to edit the CSS for the app you will need to set up the styleguide.

```
  git clone https://github.com/jordanddisch/styleguide-starter-nb
```

```
  cd styleguide-starter-nb
```

```
  bower install
```

```
  npm install
```

```
  gulp watch
```

You should be able to run the styleguide with gulp watch.
